### Principles and Concepts
ESP8266 is a truly compelling device because of its low cost and thumbsize form factor making IoT truly democratic. However, there are two major challenges of using ESP8266 boards. The first one is it's lack of analog / digital pins. The second one is it's base voltage which 3.3 Volts, not enough to trigger relays and power sensors. Though there are sensors and relays that are rated 3.3V, they are not commonly available. The most common ones are rated 5V. Assembly 8 will solve these problems and consolidate into one integrated solution.
